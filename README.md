HSC Study Tool Development Plan:

Project Overview: This report outlines the development plan for a web-based HSC study tool designed to assist students in preparing for their Higher School Certificate exams. The tool will focus on core functionalities like web scraping of past papers, data analysis, spaced repetition flashcards, and user progress tracking.
Key Features:
Web Scraping: Extract relevant information from HSC past papers across different subjects and years.
Data Analysis: Organize and categorize scraped data for efficient retrieval and filtering.
Flashcards: Implement the SM-2 algorithm for spaced repetition of practice questions.
Progress Tracking: Monitor user performance through completed questions, correct answers, and time spent studying.
Optional Features: Considering advanced functionalities like personalized recommendations, NLP analysis, and VR integration in future iterations.


Technology Stack:
Development Language: Python3 with conda
Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup, Selenium
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
Flashcards: Anki API integration???
Web Interface: Django or Flask or Pygame
Machine Learning (Optional): TensorFlow, PyTorch


Development Process:
Agile Methodology: Break down the project into manageable tasks and utilize Kanban boards for progress tracking.
MVP Focus: Prioritize core functionalities for initial release and gather user feedback for future updates.
